the commits named folder issue removed hold an advance css mini project which has a dynamically 360 deg border glowing card 

the commit named "learnt using and working with search bar" is another mini project where I learnt how to use .filter and .trim to make a viable search bar that searches names from contact flashcards with modified css visuals 

the commit named "js flashcards with priority dependent contact visuals" is a js based miniproject in which I made flashcards which are visible depending upon priority chosen, at once all the cards of the chosen priority will be present and that chosen stack will show one card at a time and cards can get changed using arrow-up and arrow-down buttons on the left of the card which shows next card of the chosen priority stack on pressing arrow down and previous card on pressing arrow-up.
Along with that there's a plus button which opens a form to dynamically add new card entry and shows alert if the form is submitted without filling all the inputs.
